+ handling different languages
    right now it will force using the subtitle language configured in the addon for the stream language
    this will wreck things if selecting a stream for a different language.
    for example right now viewing series will return all languages, but if I pick e.g. a Polish series it will break
    when trying to fetch the german (my configured language) stream from the streamdata for the Polish series.

    we either only display results that match the configured language, or we need to pass the language information for
    the series/episodes around?

+ listing series marks all as already viewed or even not viewed, no matter what I do
  maybe the "is_completed" flag by crunchy determines if the anime as a whole is finished, and it is not indicating
  that I have viewed that series?


+ not currently an issue, but we need to see what happens if the refresh-token also expires - we now cache the session
  data and if the regular token has expired, the refresh token will be used to refresh the session. which also may have
  expired, but not sure how to check or catch that

+ there's warning "Attempt to use invalid handle -1" - it's possible that this is caused by the new "add to playlist"
  functionality. it's not critical, but should check that.
